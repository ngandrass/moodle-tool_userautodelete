# Automatic User Deletion

This plugin automatically deletes users that have not logged in for a configurable number of days.

Automatically deleting users is useful to keep your database clean and remove old accounts that are no longer needed.
The plugin can be configured to send warning emails a number of days before the user is deleted. This gives users the
chance to log back in and keep their accounts active. It furthermore supports deleting users in a GDPR-compliant way,
leaving no trace of personally identifiable information (PII) inside the user record.


## Features

- Automatically deleting inactive user accounts
- Sending warning emails to users before deletion
- GDPR-compliant deletion of user accounts
- Ignoring users with specific roles
- Highly configurable (deletion and warning thresholds, email templates, enabling/disabling of single features, etc.)
- Logging of deletion events


## Configuration and Usage

The plugin can be configured via the Moodle site administration under _Site administration > Plugins > Admin tools >
Automatic user deletion_. After installation, the plugin will be disabled by default until you configure and enable it.
